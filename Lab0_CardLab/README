This assignment is meant to help you familiarize yourself with the syntax of Standard ML as well as
 the testing facilities used throughout all the lab assignments. You will implement a function
 officiating a card game as described in the pdf file. After downloading and decompressing the 
 assignment archive, you should see these files or folders:

 1. sources.cm
 2. support.cm
 3. lib/
 4. CardType.sml
 5. CarElt.sml
 6. MoveElt.sml
 7. ReferenceCard.sml
 8. tester.sml
 9. README file
10. Assignment.pdf
11. Tests.sml *
12. CardProblem.sml *

You should only modify the last 2 files, denoted by *. Provide a solution to the problem, and replace the dummy 
implementation of officiate in CardProblem.sml. Do NOT modify other parts of the file.

To aid with testing we have provided a testing structure, Tester, which should simplify the testing process. 
Tester will test your implementations against test cases speciÔ¨Åed within Tests.sml.
Test cases should be added to the tests list in the Tests structure. To compile and load everything into the SML/NJ REPL,
run 'CM.make "sources.cm"' within the REPL.In order to test your code, after running CM.make, 
you will need to call the following function:
Tester.testCard ()
